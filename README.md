## ✨ What is Go? 
Go (or Golang) is an open-source programming language developed at Google. It's known for its simplicity, concurrency, and blazing fast performance.

---

## 🔧 Key Features
- ⚡ **Fast Compilation & Execution**
- 🧵 **Built-in Concurrency** with Goroutines
- 🔒 **Strongly Typed** and Statically Compiled
- 📦 **Excellent Tooling** & Package Management

---

## 📦 Basic Syntax

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Gopher! 🐹")
}
```

---

## 🔁 Control Structures

```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

if x > 10 {
    fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")
}
```

## Differance between Nodejs and Go

| Feature                | Node.js                                             | Go (Golang)                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**               | JavaScript runtime environment                      | Compiled programming language                       |
| **Language**           | JavaScript                                          | Go (Golang)                                         |
| **Concurrency Model**  | Event-driven, non-blocking I/O, single-threaded     | Goroutines and channels for lightweight concurrency |
| **Performance**        | Good for I/O-bound tasks, slower for CPU-bound      | High performance for both I/O and CPU-bound tasks   |
| **Compilation**        | Interpreted (JIT via V8)                            | Compiled to native binaries                         |
| **Standard Library**   | Moderate, relies on npm ecosystem                   | Rich, powerful standard library                     |
| **Deployment**         | Requires Node.js runtime                            | Deploys as a single static binary                   |
| **Error Handling**     | Exceptions (try/catch)                              | Multiple return values (result, err)                |
| **Use Cases**          | Web servers, APIs, real-time apps                   | Web servers, APIs, networking, system tools         |
| **Learning Curve**     | Easy for JavaScript developers                      | Simple syntax, statically typed                     |
| **Community/Ecosystem**| Large npm package ecosystem                         | Growing, strong support from Google                 |



## Go is better compare to nodejs in cpu intensive task
